    <h3>
        Hi! </br>
        Thank you for trying to make this world a better place by showing your interest on learning more about how eco-friendly the products you purchase are.</br>
        </br>
        This is part of an experiment, where we are trying to learn more about how many people are actually willing to take an action to learn about it. Sorry for taking your precious time now, but through your current efforts, hopefully we will come back with
        a solution for you soon!
    </h3>
