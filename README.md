This repository is used to run an experiment within a university course.

We are trying to identify whether people during their groceries are interested in knowing more about the footprint of the products they are buying.
Putting a small effort by visiting this page, we conclude that the person is actually willing to act. By counting the visitors throughout a fixed time range, we are going to make our conclusions.
